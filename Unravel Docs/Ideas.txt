If a player wants to do something requiring a SKILL check they simply type !roll skill
which will generate some number of successes. the number of possible successes increases with the level of the SKILL

The DM looks at the result and determins an appropriate DC

They then check the appropriate STAT. if this is greater than the number of successes requried for the player to meet the DC, 
the player succedes with DC - SKILL threats, otherwise they fail.

threats are downsides which do not directly contradict the players aim, but hinder them in some way. These may include unexpected side effects or partial successes 


OTHER IDEAS;

Bring back the title system. Having an appropriate title lowers the DC on checks, and makes previously impossible things feasable
